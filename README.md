### 2. Create a New Branch

### 4. Stage and Commit Changes

Once you have made changes, stage and commit them to the branch you created:

1. Stage all the changes:

   git add .

2. Commit the changes with a message:

   git commit -m "Description of the changes"

### 5. Push Your Changes to GitHub

Once your changes are committed, push the branch to GitHub:

git push origin your-branch-name

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the repository on GitHub: [Printer-App](https://github.com/tisdalet/Printer-App).
2. You should see a banner or button suggesting you create a pull request for the branch you just pushed.
3. Click **"Compare & pull request"** and provide a description of the changes made.
4. Submit the pull request for review.

### 7. Syncing with the Latest Updates (Optional)

If other team members have made changes and you want to get the latest version of the repository:

1. Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch:

   git pull origin main

2. If you are on a feature branch and want to sync with `main`, merge those changes into your branch:

   git merge main

3. Resolve any conflicts, if necessary, and continue working on your feature branch.

### Notes:
- Ensure you are always working on a new branch to avoid conflicts in the `main` branch.
- When pushing changes, always push your feature branch, not directly to `main` without proper review.
